# eleventy-plugin-edelweiss

Allows to write template in more fashionable way using [Edelweiss](https://github.com/YevhenKap/edelweiss).

## Status - WIP

This is an experimental plugin.

### TODO

- [] - Invalidate _require_ cash to add ability to recompile template on every change. 
- [] - Attach _shortcodes_ and _filters_ to template function or class.
- [] - Transpile source code to have a ability to use the most modern ECMAScript syntax. Is it even possible?

## Word from author

Have fun! ✌️ ... Maybe in future. Not yet...
